# Expo Router vs React Navigation

This repository was created to compare Expo Router to React Navigation.

## Expo Router

The main branch of this repository implements a sample app using Expo Router. This was copied
from [here](https://github.com/expo/router/tree/main/apps/demo) and modified to make it working.

To use it execute:

```
yarn install && yarn start
```

And run it on your iOS Simulator, for example.

## React Navigation

The `react-navigation` branch contains the Expo Router sample app, translated to use React
Navigation.

To use it execute:

```
git checkout react-navigation
yarn install && yarn start
```

And run it on your iOS Simulator, for example.
